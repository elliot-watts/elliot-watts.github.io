    review_content: 'This is my kind of science fiction, kind of ALIENS -esque. You arrive at a planet (in this case a mining outpost) no one is answering your hails, you are tasked with suiting up and going in blind to find out what has happened. Like ALIENS these are infantry soldiers and, in this case, inmates pressed into service to secure their freedom (which adds an interesting dynamic). As they explore the outpost things get curiouser and curiouser. Recommended.'

And as always, <strong>all</strong> my books are available on Amazon Kindle Unlimited.

A decorated soldier finds himself in a situation that takes him to the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy. Getting back to his family might be his top priority, but command has other plans for him and his squad. He learns that things aren’t always what they seem, so it’s hard to trust people you just met.
