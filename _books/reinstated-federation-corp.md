  review_content: "<p>This is my kind of science fiction, kind of ALIENS -esque. You
    arrive at a planet (in this case a mining outpost) no one is answering your hails,
    you are tasked with suiting up and going in blind to find out what has happened.
    Like ALIENS these are infantry soldiers and, in this case, inmates pressed into
    service to secure their freedom (which adds an interesting dynamic). As they explore
    the outpost things get curiouser and curiouser. Recommended.</p>"

A decorated soldier finds himself in a situation that takes him to the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy.
